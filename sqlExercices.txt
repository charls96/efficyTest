SQL QUERIES (35 min)

2.1 Companies

    1.Define a query that counts the total number of .com Companies 
        (NAME ends with .com) located in Bangkok or Brussels

        SELECT COUNT(NAME)
        FROM COMPANIES
        WHERE LOWER(NAME) LIKE '%.com'
        AND (LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'bangkok' OR LOWER(CITY) LIKE 'brussels')

    2.Define a query that selects the top 5 cities, sorted by the 
    highest number of occurrences on top.

        SELECT DISTINCT(CITY)
        FROM COMPANIES
        GROUP BY CITY
        ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
        LIMIT 5

2.2 Companies and Contacts

    1.Select a unique list of K_COMPANY for all Companies with at least
    one contact linked without using joins.

        SELECT COMPANIES.K_COMPANY
        FROM COMPANIES, CONT_COMP
        WHERE COMPANIES.K_COMPANY = CONT_COMP.K_COMPANY

    2. Select all companies that are linked or not to contacts. All columns
    from tables COMPANIES and CONTACTS (joined by CONT_COMP) must be 
    selected in only one statement. The result should be sorted by Company
     name (A-z), second by Contact name (Z-a).

        SELECT COMPANIES.*, CONTACTS.*
        FROM CONT_COMP
        RIGHT JOIN COMPANIES ON COMPANIES.K_COMPANY=CONT_COMP.K_COMPANY
        LEFT JOIN CONTACTS ON CONTACTS.K_CONTACT=CONT_COMP.K_CONTACT
        ORDER BY COMPANIES.NAME, CONTACTS.NAME

    3.Count the number of contacts without a link to a Company.

        SELECT COUNT(CONTACTS.K_CONTACT)
        FROM CONT_COMP
        LEFT JOIN COMPANIES ON COMPANIES.K_COMPANY=CONT_COMP.K_COMPANY
        RIGHT JOIN CONTACTS ON CONTACTS.K_CONTACT=CONT_COMP.K_CONTACT
        WHERE COMPANIES.K_COMPANY IS NULL
